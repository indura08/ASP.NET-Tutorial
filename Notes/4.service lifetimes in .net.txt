In .NET, services have different lifetimes that determine how they are instantiated and how long they live. Here are the main types of service lifetimes, explained simply:

1.Transient:

What it means: A new instance of the service is created every time it is requested.
Use case: When you need a lightweight service with little or no state. For example, a service that formats a date.

example:services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();


2.Scoped:

What it means: A new instance of the service is created per scope. In a web application, a scope is usually a single HTTP request.
Use case: When you need to maintain state across a single request but not between requests. For example, a service that handles user data for the duration of a single request.

example: services.AddScoped<IMyService, MyService>();


3.Singleton:

What it means: A single instance of the service is created and shared throughout the applicationâ€™s lifetime.
Use case: When you need to maintain state across the entire application and ensure only one instance exists. For example, a service that caches data.

example:services.AddSingleton<IMyService, MyService>();


Transient: New instance per request. Good for lightweight and stateless services.
Scoped: New instance per scope (e.g., per HTTP request). Good for maintaining state during a single request.
Singleton: One instance for the entire application. Good for shared data and state across the application.
