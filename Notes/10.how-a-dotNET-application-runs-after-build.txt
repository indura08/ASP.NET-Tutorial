Q: please explain how a asp.net application run ? first i have to build the projcet no? please explain everyhting step by step in detail , and in simpler terms?

A:

🔹 Step 1: Writing the ASP.NET Code

When you create an ASP.NET application, you write your code in C# inside controllers, models, and views or APIs.

For example, if you’re building a simple Web API, you might have a controller like this:

using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

[Route("api/hello")]
[ApiController]
public class HelloController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet]
    public string Get()
    {
        return "Hello, World!";
    }
}


This is a simple API controller that returns "Hello, World!" when accessed.

🔹 Step 2: Building the Project

What does "building" mean?
----------------------------
Your C# code is just text; it needs to be converted into a format that the computer can understand.
The dotnet build command compiles (translates) your C# code into DLL (Dynamic Link Library) files that can be executed.

How to Build an ASP.NET Project?
----------------------------------
In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project folder and run:

	" dotnet build "

🔹 This will:

✅ Check for errors in your code.
✅ Compile your code into a folder called bin/Debug/net8.0/ (or net7.0, etc., depending on the version).
✅ Create a DLL file (e.g., MyApp.dll) inside this folder.

🔹 Step 3: Running the Application

After building, you can now run the application.

How to Run an ASP.NET Project?

Run the following command:

	" dotnet run "

OR, if you want to run the built DLL file directly:

	" dotnet bin/Debug/net8.0/MyApp.dll "

This will start the ASP.NET web server, and you will see output like this:
